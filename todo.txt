HOW TO DO IT
============

* create a script runner?
	* should this all just be a bash script or should it be a python script?

============
* What has to be done before this script can be run?
    * setup github?
    * I'd like for ssh config stuff to be done right
        * got to start writing in stuff in my files though. Ugh.
